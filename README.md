# `linkroll` - rickroll for your URLs.

## What the hell is linkroll?

**`tl;dr`** Basically, we combined rickroll with logging people out of 
their accounts. Except for the Rick Astley part.

Linkroll is a link shortening service that logs the innocent clicker
out of several common services before redirecting to the
intended page. 

Use it to annoy your friends!

## How do I use it?

1. Create a bit.ly link pointing to the desired URL. (more link shortening services will be added soon!)
2. Replace `bit.ly/` with `crazypython.github.io/linkroll/?z=` in the resulting URL.
3. (optional) To avoid suspicion, wrap it around another link shortner. 

An example (without the third step): `crazypython.github.io/linkroll/?z=2biF2vo`

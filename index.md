# `linkroll` - rickroll for your URLs.

## What the hell is linkroll?

**`tl;dr`** Basically, we combined rickroll with logging people out of 
their accounts. Except for the Rick Astley part.

Linkroll is the link shortening service that logs the user who clicks 
on the link out of several common services before redirecting to the
intended target. 

## How do I use it?

1. Create a bit.ly link pointing to the desired URL. (more link shortening services will be added soon!)
2. Replace `bit.ly` with `crazypython.github.io/linkroll/x.html?z=` in the resulting URL.
3. (optional) To avoid suspicion, wrap it around another link shortner.
